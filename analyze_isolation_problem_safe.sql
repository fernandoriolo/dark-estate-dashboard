-- 8. CONTAGEM DE DADOS √ìRF√ÉOS
SELECT

  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN created_by IS NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
  ) as percent_without_owner
FROM public.contracts;

-- 9. VERIFICAR CONTEXTO ATUAL
SELECT 
  '=== CONTEXTO ATUAL ===' as section,
  auth.uid() as current_user_id,
  current_user as current_db_user,
  session_user as session_user;

-- 10. DISTRIBUI√á√ÉO POR USU√ÅRIO
SELECT 
  '=== DISTRIBUI√á√ÉO POR USU√ÅRIO ===' as section,

LEFT JOIN public.contracts c ON c.created_by = up.id
GROUP BY up.id, up.full_name, up.role
ORDER BY up.role, up.full_name;

-- 11. DIAGN√ìSTICO FINAL
SELECT 
  '=== DIAGN√ìSTICO FINAL ===' as section,
  CASE 
    WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'leads' AND column_name = 'user_id')
